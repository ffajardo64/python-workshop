# Programming in Python

## Workshop Information

* Live session will take place on June 16, 2021: Zoom link TBA


## Instructors

* [Milena Tsvetkova](m.tsvetkova@lse.ac.uk), Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science, Department of Methodology, LSE
* Yuanmo He (GTA), PhD student in Social Research Methodology, Department of Methodology, LSE

## Description

This workshop introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming in Python. The workshop is intended for students who lack a formal background in the field. Topics include data types, control structures, functions, and an introduction to the principles of object-oriented programming. We will learn to design, write, and debug simple computer programs, using practical examples from computational social science and social data science.


## Prerequisites

This is an introductory workshop and no prior experience with programming or Python is required.


## Software

The workshop will use Jupyter Notebooks to edit and write code. Students have two options:

1. Pre-install Python and Jupyter Notebooks locally on your personal computer. We recommend simply installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which comes with both, as well as with the most common data science packages.

2. Alternatively, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) to work in the cloud. In this case, you do not not need to pre-install any software but you need to have a Google account.


## Materials

All materials for the workshop are available at [https://github.com/social-research/python-workshop](https://github.com/social-research/python-workshop).

Additional optional resources include:
* [Python Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming)
* Matthes, Eric. [*Python Crash Course Cheat Sheet*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html).
* [Intermediate and advanced Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/)


## Detailed outline

1. Introduction to programming languages
  * Primitive constructs, syntax, static semantics, and semantics
  * Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
2. Primitives in Python
  * Scalar data types, operators, expressions, and value assignment to variables
  * Non-scalar data types: `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`
  * Sequence operations and methods: indexing, slicing, joining, splitting, aliasing, and cloning
3. Control flow in Python
  * Branching with `if`, `elif`, and `else`
  * Iteration with `while` and `for`
  * `range()` and list comprehensions
4. Functions in Python
  * Function arguments and variable scope
  * Data abstraction with objects and classes
